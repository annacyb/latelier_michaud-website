        <p>
          In Atelier Michaud, we strongly believe in contributing to a better
          and greener future of the jewellery industry, and all our activity and
          interests, from producing to selling and after-caring, is carried out
          with a strong focus on UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 3
          “Good Health and Well-Being” and 13 “Climate Action”.
        </p>

        <h1>Choices</h1>
        <img src="../images/cho_line.png" alt="line" />
        <p>
          We strongly believe in our own responsibility towards climate change
          and supporting the STG 13, “Climate Action” by constantly searching
          for and implementing sustainable solutions whenever possible. All our
          jewelry is made using only bio gold, recycled sterling silver and
          certified precious stones, and our jewelry boxes, bags and displays
          are made from recycled/upcycled materials.
