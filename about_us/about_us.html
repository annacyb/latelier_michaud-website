          The journey of the brand started in the very early childhood of
          Pauline as she has always been seeking new ways for creative
          self-expression. From making jewellery from old beads, she has grown
          both personally and professionally and moved to Paris to attend
          business school. <br /><br />

          After the French adventure, she returned to Denmark to start education
          in “Jewellery, Technology and Business” at KEA in 2018. This is when
          Atelier Michaud has come to life – Pauline had a chance to pursue her
          dream as a jewellery designer and started designing and producing the
          pieces in her own apartment.

          Pauline is drawn to organic and delicate shapes - mix of
          sophistication and modern bohemian. She gets inspiration from the wild
          nature and little nuances in day to day life. Currently, she is
          looking at outsourcing the production to Thailand to a small workshop
          to improve the technique and provide better product for her customers.
